So this project is currently very small and everyone working on it knows eachother. 
If you already know someone on this project and want to help message them and we can walk you through everything.
If you don't know someone on this project -Congrats- you probably don't want to get involved, but you can contact us if you do.


If you find an issue feel free to tag it as such in the issues section, and I'm reasonably sure we can't stop anyone from forking the project.

So enjoy.
