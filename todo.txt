Looking for something to do/ bored with current project?

Try any of these out for size:

Switch the system to use Vec3s rather than 3 ints 

getNeighbors(int VoxelX, int VoxelY, int VoxelZ){
	/*A function which takes in a blocks positions (Vec3) and
	returns an array of the six neighbors poisitons (Vec3) in order
	Top, Bottom, North, East, South, West */
}

isLit(int VoxelX, intVoxelY, int VoxelZ){
	/*A function which takes in a blocks positons (Vec3) and 
	return a value for how much light is on the block
	early iterations might include only a 1 or 0
}
